# üìå JSON Editor Clone (Privacy-First)

## üéØ Goal
Build a modern **JSON editor web application** (like [jsoneditoronline.org](https://jsoneditoronline.org)) where **all JSON data is processed locally in the user‚Äôs browser**, ensuring privacy, fast performance, and offline availability.  
The app should have a **clean, modern UI**.

## üöÄ Building and Running

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the development server and open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

3.  **Build for Production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will create a `dist` directory with the production-ready files.

4.  **Lint the Code:**
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
    This will run ESLint to check for any linting errors.

## ‚ú® Recent Updates & Improvements

This section outlines the significant features and bug fixes implemented to enhance the JSON Editor's functionality and user experience.

### New Features

*   **Base64 Support:**
    *   Introduced a new input mode allowing users to switch between JSON and Base64 content editing.
    *   Implemented conditional validation for both JSON and Base64 input types, ensuring content integrity based on the selected mode.
    *   Added a "Decode Base64" action button that decodes Base64 strings, attempts to parse and format the result as JSON, updates the editor content, and automatically switches the input mode to JSON.
    *   The status bar now dynamically updates to display "Valid Base64" when valid Base64 content is present.

### UI/UX Enhancements

*   **Decode Icon Behavior:** The "Decode Base64" icon is now consistently visible in the toolbar but is disabled when the editor is not in Base64 input mode, providing clearer user feedback.
*   **Cursor Position on Paste:** Implemented a fix to ensure the editor cursor remains at the end of pasted content, particularly for Base64 strings, by trimming leading/trailing whitespace.
*   **Table View Overflow:** Addressed an issue where large JSON data caused the Table View to overflow its container. Table cells now correctly wrap content (`break-words`) to maintain layout integrity.

### Bug Fixes & Stability

*   **Infinite Loop Resolution:** Fixed a critical "Maximum update depth exceeded" error by refining `useEffect` dependencies in the `useJsonData` hook, preventing recursive state updates.
*   **`formatJson` Usage Correction:** Resolved issues related to the `formatJson` utility's import and usage, ensuring correct JSON formatting across the application.
*   **Monaco Editor Diagnostics:** Explicitly configured Monaco Editor to disable JSON diagnostics when the input mode is set to Base64, preventing erroneous "Expected a JSON object" validation messages.
*   **Loading State Restoration:** Re-introduced `isLoading` and `setLoading` properties to the `jsonStore` to correctly manage and reflect application loading states, particularly during file operations.
