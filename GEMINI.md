## üöÄ Building and Running

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the development server and open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

3.  **Build for Production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will create a `dist` directory with the production-ready files.

4.  **Lint the Code:**
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
    This will run ESLint to check for any linting errors.
